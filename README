NAME
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::Plack::Session - Easily access the current
    request's Plack session

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.001 of
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::Plack::Session - released June 03, 2012 as
    part of Catalyst-TraitFor-Request-Plack-Session.

SYNOPSIS
        # in your app class
        use CatalystX::RoleApplicator;
        __PACKAGE__->apply_request_class_roles(qw/
            Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::Plack::Session
        /);

        # then, off in an action/view/whatever somewhere...
        my $ps = $ctx->req->plack_session;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a tiny little Catalyst::Request class trait that allows easy,
    lazy access to the Plack session, on demand.

    Note that for this to make any sense at all, you need to be using
    Plack::Middleware::Session.

ATTRIBUTES
  plack_session
    A place to stash the session, if we've created it.

METHODS
  plack_session
    Returns the Plack::Session object for this request. If necessary the
    session object will be constructed.

SEE ALSO
    Please see those modules/websites for more information related to this
    module.
